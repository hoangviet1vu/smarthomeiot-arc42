# Smarthome Iot

 **Smarthome Iot** is a **microservices-based IoT platform** designed for the **registration, management, and monitoring** of up to 1 million **IoT devices** deployed across **multiple buildings**. Devices are logically structured under a hierarchy of **Building, Floor, Area, and Room**, enabling precise **location tracking** and **streamlined operations**. The system supports three main user roles: **Engineers** who install and register devices on-site, **Administrators** who monitor system health and respond to building-level events, and **End Users** who can control and monitor their in-house devices, such as cameras, lights, or air conditioners, via personalized interfaces. The architecture ensures **scalability**, **real-time responsiveness**, and **flexibility** for **large-scale smart building environments**.
