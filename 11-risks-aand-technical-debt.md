## 11. Risks and Technical Debt
Risks and technical debt are actively tracked and managed as part of the product backlog. Each identified item is recorded as a **ticket with assigned priority**, and the team allocates **10â€“15% of sprint capacity** to address them during regular development cycles.

The level of effort dedicated to risk mitigation and debt reduction may be **adjusted based on real-time product priorities** and milestones defined in the **Quality Roadmap**. Any changes to this allocation will be made **through open discussion and alignment with the Product Manager**, ensuring a balance between feature delivery and long-term maintainability.
