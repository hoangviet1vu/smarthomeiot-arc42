## 6. Runtime View

This section presents three key **runtime use cases** that demonstrate how the system behaves during typical operational workflows. Each scenario outlines the dynamic interactions between core microservices, external platforms, and users to fulfill specific business processes. The selected use cases cover both administrative and operational aspects of the system:

- **Building Construction by Administrator** – Setting up buildings, areas, floors, and rooms, and assigning responsibility through user groups.

- **Device Registration** – Installing and registering new IoT equipment and notifying responsible users via email and push notification.

- **Device Event Processing** – Retrieving real-time device events from Tuya Cloud, transforming and analyzing data, and initiating follow-up actions.

These scenarios illustrate how the system leverages **microservices**, **event-driven messaging**, and **external integrations** to support smart building operations in a scalable and modular way.
