## 8.Crosscutting Concepts

This section outlines the **system-wide architectural strategies** and design patterns that are applied consistently across all services in the Smarthome IoT platform. These crosscutting concepts influence the structure, behavior, and operational reliability of the system. The focus is placed on four critical areas that ensure security, resilience, and maintainability:

- Authentication and Authorization
- Microservices Dependency Management
- Event-Driven Strategy
- System Observability

Each of the following subsections describes the approach, tools, and principles adopted to address these concerns in a scalable and cloud-native manner.

### 8.1 Authentication and Authorization
